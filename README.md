The following contains the computational model of a damped-driven pendulum. The model was used to find the regions of chaos for a varying driving amplitude. Bifurcation Plots, and Poincar\'e sections were plotted to find these regimes, and the presence of chaos was also studied using the Lyapunov Exponent.
